## The art of software engineering

When you see a masterpiece, it feels different. One may not be able to explain it always, but you know it. Every engineering has an art element in it which engineers sometime overlook. The art does not mean that engineering has been violated, but rather best practices have been applied to create a product. Software engineering is an art as much as it is a science. So, software can be viewed by those lens. In fact, many architects and designers know that is right lens for the software that will last and serve millions of users.

## Insights from the code

Good code is cornerstone for great software. Lot of architects, designers strive for certain design principles that go into the construction of great product. Unfortunately, verifying these in the final product is depdendent on the reviewer. Also, this verification is beyond what testing can guarantee. Testing is rather well defined with expected outputs. Adherence to design principles and its verification will ensure that product will be maintainable (which testing cannot tell, or atleast not easily). Maintainability also has many attributes, like people will be able to understand, reason, improve, debug the software product in the long run.

Hence, this project aims at building a *framework* that will help the software engineers analyze, understand, maintain software with confidence !!

## The Architecture Interfaces

Defining the abstract components and the interfaces is often the first step of a framework definition. So, this section will 
get that step started.
